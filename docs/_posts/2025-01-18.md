On January 18, 2025, President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to intensify immigration enforcement immediately after his inauguration. He stated, "We will begin removing the illegal aliens who have infiltrated our country." 

This announcement has raised concerns among immigrant communities and human rights organizations, who fear that such actions could lead to widespread detentions and deportations, potentially separating families and disrupting communities.
