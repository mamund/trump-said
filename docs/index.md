On February 26, 2025, President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine can:

> "forget about" joining NATO. ([cite](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14401705/zelensky-confirms-trump-meet-ukraine-russia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

He said the NATO alliance was a trigger for the ongoing conflict with Russia. 

** Reality Check**\
_Trump’s statement undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and emboldens Russia, signaling that aggression wins concessions. It weakens NATO’s credibility, discourages allies, and risks broader instability in Europe. By denying Ukraine’s path to NATO, the U.S. loses leverage over Russia and damages Western unity, making future conflicts more likely and endangering global security._

On February 25, 2025, President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on the European Union, stating:

**Reality Check**\
_Trump’s claim is incorrect because the EU was created to foster economic cooperation and prevent war in Europe, not to target the U.S.  This rhetoric risks economic retaliation, weakens Western unity, and emboldens adversaries like China and Russia._

### 2025-02-24
On February 24, 2025, during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, President Donald Trump stated:

> "We've been mistreated very badly by many countries, not just Canada and Mexico. We've been taken advantage of." ([cite](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-on-time-with-tariffs-canada-mexico-2025-02-24/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Reality Check:**\
_This claim is subjective and lacks concrete evidence. While the U.S. has trade deficits with some nations, these are often the result of complex economic factors rather than intentional mistreatment. Additionally, the U.S. maintains numerous alliances and partnerships worldwide, indicating mutual cooperation rather than widespread mistreatment._

On February 22, 2025, during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, President Donald Trump delivered a speech where he stated:

([cite](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-urges-musk-be-more-aggressive-bid-shrink-us-government-2025-02-22/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

This remark was made in the context of urging Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, to intensify efforts in reducing the size of the federal government.

**Reality Check:**\
_Aggressively cutting the U.S. government workforce could weaken essential services, disrupt national security, and harm economic stability. Sudden reductions risk losing experienced personnel, slowing critical functions like healthcare, defense, and disaster response._
